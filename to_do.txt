Currently in the middle of figuring out how to trim the line breaks in the
matrix containing the map.✅

Everything appears to be working well, except when i try to trim the line breaks.
Otherwise, it's going well. ✅ /*fixed*/

currently doing the checks for the map.
the checks are not producing the expected output. gotta look into that.✅

mlx behaves differently everytime it runs. wtf?
apparently it loops around: 1st- works. 2nd- segfault. 3rd- segfault. 4th- works again
(something like that)
